    The Graphical Nix Project is a project that aims to create effective, all-encompassing graphical interfaces for the Nix package manager and the Nix programming language. This project is still in the early stages of development. Due to the complicated nature of Nix and NixOS, and the endless rabbit holes that you can go down with the package manager, it is very difficult to make a centralized configuration interface that is easy for anyone to use. Many have tried; however, most end up unmaintained or restricted in their use cases. Let's see where this goes!

## Goals
Configuring your OS or packages should not require hours of research, reading through a large amount of docs, and trial & error.
What Gnix is:
 - Powerful tool for any Nix user
 - Both Graphical and CLI, most functionality in the GUI will also be aivalable to use in the CLI
   
What Gnix is not:
 - Limited to an "app store" or simple package downloads, it manages configurations, versions, and more
 - a tool for development (if you are developing on nix, just learn to use it, move out of your comfort zone)
 - limited to NixOs
## Repos
### GNix
The centralized GUI for managing Nix shells, Nixos configurations and packages
based on the PyQT5 framework
### NixAnalyzer
The backend for the GNix project, a rust CLI that functions similar to a language server, but it can also refactor, templates and generate nix code
### NixNodes
A graphical programming interface (similar to blender's compositor and unreals graph scripting) to manage more complex Nix files in a unified visual environment. Qt C++
